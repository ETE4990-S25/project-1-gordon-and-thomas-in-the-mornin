- [Mafia](https://github.com/ETE4990-S25/project-1-mafia/pull/2/files) - Group was orgianlly assigned in the first round but was reassigned. I've already made comments on the code at the time so I will leave them here.



### Code Review
- Comment made: 26 Solid Comments 
- Commit tracing was a really fun experience seeing the progression of the code and how it changed over time.
- Most Common Mistake: No Readme file, not breaking down to differet classes, and planned functions that were not implemented.
- Group [A journey](https://github.com/ETE4990-S25/project-1-a-journey/pull/1/files?diff=unified&w=0)  had code but I code not get it to run. Also contained corrented files so I couldnt open the juypiter notebook to see the history of runnin the code.
- Best made project was [Galaxy](https://github.com/ETE4990-S25/project-1-team-galaxy/pull/7). They had the most sound code and a working game. Some functions could be condensed down to save space.
